(Separate Chaining) HashMap (with resizing) has a perfect performance on avarage:
    Big Theta of 1 - contains
    Big Theta of 1 - add
So we are encouraged to use HashMap, instead of Array, when we only care about the existence of some items,
and don't want to apply any operations on them. This way we will have much better performance.

[Python] HashMap is represented by dictionary
1. initialize:
    map = {}
    map = dic()
2. add:
    map[key] = value
3. contains:
    in / not in
4. retrieve:
    map[key]
5. traverse:
    for key in map.keys():
    for key in map:
    for value in map.values():
    for key, value in map.items()
