(Separate Chaining) HashSet (with resizing) has a perfect performance on avarage:
    Big Theta of 1 - contains
    Big Theta of 1 - add
So we are encouraged to use HashSet, instead of Array, when we only care about the existence of some items,
and don't want to apply any operations on them. This way we will have much better performance.

[Python] HashSet is represented by set
1. initialize:
    Set = set()
2. add:
    Set.add(item)
3. contains:
    in / not in
4. traverse:
    for item in Set
